During my work , I encountered various challenges and made significant progress.
The initial step was to load the dataset using Pandas.
I faced issues with missing and inconsistent data,
which were resolved by removing rows with missing values and standardizing the data format. 
This data cleaning process was essential for ensuring the accuracy of the subsequent analysis and models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was crucial for understanding the patterns and relationships in the data. 
Visualizations helped identify trends and correlations, providing a solid foundation for the analysis.
My journey from the start of the unit to now has been transformative. 
Initially, I struggled with the syntax and functionalities of the libraries. 
However, through consistent practice and application, 
I have become proficient in data manipulation and visualization,
and I am now more comfortable with the entire process of data analysis and model building. 
In the future, I am interested in applying these skills to more complex datasets and problems,
possibly involving deep learning techniques.
I am also keen on exploring the use of data science in fields such as healthcare, 
finance, and environmental science.

I chose the dataset on life expectancy and healthy life expectancy at birth and age 60 from various WHO regions and years.
This dataset was compelling because it provides insights into the health and longevity of different populations over time.
The primary problem I aimed to address was understanding the factors that influence life expectancy and how it varies across different regions and genders. 
This involved identifying significant predictors and trends in the data.

For the classification tasks in this portfolio, I used Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models.
Logistic Regression was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability,
while KNN was selected for its ability to capture non-linear relationships.
The analysis revealed that life expectancy is influenced by several factors, 
including gender and region. The models showed varying levels of accuracy, 
with Logistic Regression performing moderately well.
The results aligned with my expectations, as life expectancy generally tends to be higher in more developed regions and for females.

Working on Portfolio 4 has been an enriching experience, 
enhancing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
I have learned to approach problems systematically,
clean and explore data effectively, and build and evaluate models. 
This project has laid a solid foundation for my future endeavors in data science.
